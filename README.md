## Testing

```bash
# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Run the service
uv run python main.py

# Test complete extraction (end-to-end)
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/extract_home_info" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "address": "2679 Castle Butte Dr",
    "city": "Castle Rock", 
    "state": "CO",
    "zip_code": "80109"
  }' | jq .

# Test URL discovery only
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/find_property_urls" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "address": "115 Hilton Ave",
    "city": "Garden City",
    "state": "NY",
    "zip_code": "11530"
  }' | jq .

# Test extraction from specific URLs
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/extract_from_urls" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "property_urls": [
      "https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/115-Hilton-Ave-Garden-City-NY-11530/94720960_zpid/"
    ],
    "address": "115 Hilton Ave, Garden City, NY 11530"
  }' | jq .
```

## How It Works

1. **Dynamic Search**: Uses Firecrawl's search API to find property URLs with queries like `"address site:zillow.com"`
2. **Smart Validation**: Validates URLs to ensure exact address match using regex patterns and address parsing
3. **Comprehensive Extraction**: Uses Firecrawl's extract API with structured schemas to pull detailed property data
4. **Data Combination**: Merges data from multiple sources to provide the most complete property information

## Deployment

This service is configured for Railway deployment with the included Dockerfile.
